StormScourges RPG is a custom (a 4 payer hero adventure/gauntlet-like rpg) map for Stormgate.

Pick a hero, explore and fight though stages, upgrade your skills and stats, defeat bosses and then prove yourself by defeating Deth himself!

Featuring 4 different heroes, 3 stages to explore, secrets to find, custom enemies to watch out for and custom bosses to die to.

Average playtime is around 40-50 minutes.

Map was created sometime after the terrain editor beta first released, implementation is 99% through data (.json editing) as triggers back then were extremely unreasonable to work with.

Much of data was copied from runtime file, so it specifies most of it's default fields, which is unneeded with data editor present. In fact,a lot of data links are now invalid, and clicking them will crash editor. Nevertheless, the map compiles and works great!
